## Exercise

Scenario: You are tasked with designing the architecture for a simple e-commerce website
that sells books. The system should support the following functionalities:

1. **User Management**: Allow users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.
2. **Product Catalog**: Display a list of books, including details such as title, author, price,
and availability.
3. **Shopping Cart**: Enable users to add books to a shopping cart, view the cart, and
proceed to checkout.
4. **Order Management**: Process user orders and manage the order history.
5. **Payment Processing**: Integrate with a payment gateway to handle payments.
6. **Administration Panel**: Allow administrators to manage the product catalog, view orders,
and update inventory.

**Expected Output:**
- A list of core components (e.g., User Service, Product Catalog Service, Order Service,
Payment Service, etc.).
- A description of how these components interact (e.g., the User Service interacts with the
Order Service to retrieve a user's order history).
- A basic system architecture diagram (e.g., a layered architecture with a front-end, back-end
services, and a database layer).
- A brief discussion on non-functional requirements.
